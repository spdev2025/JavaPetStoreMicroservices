#Killall Script
To stop all of the K3s containers and reset the containerd state, the k3s-killall.sh script can be used.

The killall script cleans up containers, K3s directories, and networking components while also removing the iptables chain with all the associated rules. The cluster data will not be deleted.

To run the killall script from a server node, run:

/usr/local/bin/k3s-killall.sh
